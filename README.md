# MicOn - Bluetooth Headset Connection Keeper

A minimal macOS app that keeps your microphone active to prevent Bluetooth headset disconnections and eliminate activation latency.

## What It Does

MicOn solves a common problem with Bluetooth headsets on macOS: when the microphone isn't actively in use, headsets often disconnect or have annoying activation delays when you need to speak. This app keeps your microphone stream active without recording anything, ensuring your headset stays connected and ready.

- üìä **Menu Bar App** - Lives quietly in your menu bar
- üöÄ **Auto-Start** - Microphone activates automatically on launch
- üéß **Device Selection** - Choose which audio device to keep active
- üîí **Privacy First** - No audio is ever recorded, processed, or saved
- üîÑ **Multi-App Support** - Shares microphone access with other apps

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone won't activate

   ```bash
   tccutil reset Microphone com.yourcompany.MicOn
   ```
3. Restart MicOn

### Bluetooth headset still disconnects
1. Ensure MicOn is running (green circle in menu bar)
2. Select your specific Bluetooth device from the dropdown
3. Check that no other apps are exclusively capturing the microphone
4. Try restarting your Bluetooth connection

### Permission keeps being requested
1. Clean build in Xcode (‚áß‚åòK)
2. Delete MicOn from Applications
3. Rebuild and reinstall
4. Grant permission once more

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- **Processor**: Apple Silicon or Intel
- **Permissions**: Microphone access

## How It Works

MicOn uses macOS audio APIs (`AVCaptureSession` or `AVAudioEngine`) to create an active audio input stream. However, unlike recording apps, it doesn't process or store the audio data - the stream simply stays open to keep your Bluetooth headset's microphone connection alive.
